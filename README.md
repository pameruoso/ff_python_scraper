# FlashFiber python scraper

This is my first experiment with Selenium.
I'm waiting for FlashFiber (https://flashfiber.it) to cover my house with FTTH connectivity but I find very annoying to go on the website and check the availability of the service manually.

I than decided to build a python script that uses the Selenium library and EdgeChromium (my fav browser) to check the website.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.X
- Selenium library installed
- msedge.selenium_tools library installed

### Preparation
- Install python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install selenium:
`pip install selenium`
- Install msedge_selenium_tools:
`pip install msedge.selenium_tools`
